1. Make the Press() function work
    - xdolib seems to be the way to go, unless xtest can be found to work
2. Find or create pathfinding solution to get the heart to a coordinate in the AttackBox
    - See Notes(2)
3. Add actual AI to handle the objects on screen
    1) start with the BattleMenuUpdate() function
    2) implement the functions for the rest of the game states
    3) The AI for the actual avoiding of the objects should be implemented as so:
        1. Have a small radius that it avoids objects in at all costs. See Notes(3)
        2. If no objects are in the radius, then use the pathfinding to go the location with the least objects near it


Once the AI for the battles works well, then:
1. Adapt pathfinding to work outside the battle
    - New computer vision method may need to be found, as Frisk is not detected when another object is nearby or obscuring the image. See Notes(1)





Notes:
    1) A new computer vision method may need to be found for outside battles, as Frisk is not detected when another object is nearby or obscuring the image.
    A hacky solution could be to adjust the threshold value intelligently until Frisk is found.

    2) go-detour seems to be the most fleshed out solution, however the documentation is difficult. The only other solution is the A* algorithm, which can be implemented through the gopathfinding package.

    3) It should find the location in the radius that is the farthest from the objects in the radius and go that direction.
